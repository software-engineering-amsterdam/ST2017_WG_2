-- According to the linked source:
-- "Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer b, 
-- the number b p âˆ’ b is an integer multiple of p"
-- However there are also non-prime numbers that hold this property. 
-- The non-prime numbers that have this property are the carmicheal numbers
-- This means that Fermat's primality check will give an incorrect answer
