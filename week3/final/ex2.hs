-- About an hour

-- Test 1 using the form generator from exercise 4
-- First, the form is turned into the string representation
-- Next, this string representation is parsed and then again
-- turned into the string representation. This function
-- checks if the result is equal to the original.

-- Test 2 using a list of tuples containing first the expression
-- to be parsed, and second the expected output of the parse function.
-- Next, it is tested by a function that tests if the parsed
-- outcome is equal to the expected outcome. This way,
-- also cases with too many ending brackets are tested.

-- We chose this solution because our implementations were similar,
-- but this one also uses the random test generator from exercise 4,
-- so QuickCheck testing is possible.
