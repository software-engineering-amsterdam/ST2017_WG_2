-- About 3 hours

-- Test 1 by checking if every clause has at least one variable that is true

-- Test 2 by generating clauses and by a function created to turn clauses back into forms
-- the form is turned into clauses and the clauses are turned back into a form
-- and then we check if that form is equal to the original.
-- Unfortunately, this shows that for very complex forms our method fails, but
-- we can't seem to find a solution.
