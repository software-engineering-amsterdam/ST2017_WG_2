-- Taking the 10 modulus of n gives you its last digit, which we add to a list. Repeating this with n divided by 10
-- (as it's a integer division, this will 'drop' the last digit) until we get to zero, results in a conversion
-- of the integer to a list of it's digits.
-- Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/3963286, which is in my opinion a very elegant way of achieving this.
-- I also looked at solutions that convert the integer to a string, but I like the fact that this solution
-- just uses integers, which is also more resource efficient.

-- Again, I decided not to use a solution that first turns the list into a string,
-- but decided to use mathematics instead. Inspired by https://stackoverflow.com/a/1918515,
-- when folding every partial result is multiplied by 10, and then the next number is added to it.

-- Double every second digit in the list.
-- First, I solved this using zipWith (*) n [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1].
-- However, using a list like that does not look very elegant and also
-- causes the function only to work correctly with lists of odd length up to 11,
-- but credit card numbers have different lengths.
-- On https://stackoverflow.com/a/17383354 I found
-- using the cycle function would be a nice way to make the function work
-- for every list length.
