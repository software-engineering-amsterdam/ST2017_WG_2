-- Finished testing/explaining my method of checking at 16:00

-- NoTriangle, Equilateral and Isosceles can be tested using quickCheck.
-- Their preconditions are relatively simple: NoTriangle needs at least one of three
-- of the random integers to be <= 0. Equilateral only needs one positive integer,
-- as all three legs are equal. Isosceles only needs two different positive integers,
-- as two of three legs are equal.

-- It is hard to test for Rectangular using a random test generator.
-- It is impossible to get a significant
-- amount of random (a,b,c) for which precondition a^2+b^2=c^2
-- or a^2+c^2=b^2 or b^2+c^2=a^2 holds.
-- Therefore, it makes more sense to check the function with a significant amount of examples
-- known to be rectangular.

-- It is possible to test for Other, as it needs three different positive numbers,
-- for which a^2+b^2=c^2, a^2+c^2=b^2 and b^2+c^2=a^2 do not hold. QuickCheck is sometimes
-- able to find 100 (a,b,c) for this, however, it often gives up after ~70-90 passed tests.
